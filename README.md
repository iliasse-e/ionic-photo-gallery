## PHOTO GALLERY App

We'll create a Photo Gallery app that offers the ability to take photos with your device's camera, display them in a grid, and store them permanently on the device.

Highlights include:

- One Angular-based codebase that runs on the web, iOS, and Android using Ionic Framework [UI components](https://ionicframework.com/docs/components).
- Deployed as a native iOS and Android mobile app using [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com), Ionic's official native app runtime.
- Photo Gallery functionality powered by the Capacitor [Camera](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/apis/camera), [Filesystem](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/apis/filesystem), and [Preferences](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/apis/preferences) APIs.
